# Overview

How do communities perceive their moderation? How do rules shape these perceptions? We study these questions in the context of Reddit, a large online community platform. We provide a dataset of Reddit posts and comments, annotated with sentiment towards moderation and rule classification. We also provide a taxonomy of rules and a classification pipeline for determining a post or comment's sentiment towards moderation.

# Dataset

We provide both a [dataset of Reddit posts and comments](moderation_sentiment.md) and a [timeline of community rules](rule_data.md). These data include sentiment towards moderation annotations and rule classification labels, anonymized to protect user privacy.
