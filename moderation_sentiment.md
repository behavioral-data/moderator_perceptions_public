## Data

All data is anonymized to exclude any identifying information. As such, we provide only the data-specific identifier, timestamp of remark, community, and sentiment class. Data can be accessed [here](../data/TODO).

We recognize the inherit difficulty of analyzing these data, which does not include remarks made that are not directed towards moderation. As such, we additionally provide per-community, per-diem talleys of remarks made, both towards moderation and not. These data can be accessed [here](../data/TODO).
