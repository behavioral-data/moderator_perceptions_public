# Rule Taxonomy and Timelines

## Overview

Rule timelines were reconstructed from the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), scraping at-most-weekly snapshots. These rules are then classified into a hierarchical taxonomy of 3 levels and 17 classes.

## Taxonomy

Rules were classified by a **GPT-4o**-based classification pipeline. For more details, see our [paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14163).

## Timelines

The classified rule timeline data is available [here](../data/TODO)
